## Overview

Satellites are a powerful tool for providing global coverage of the abundance of particulates (aka aerosol) and several key gases. Though a range of active (satellite emits and detects visible or other radiation) and passive (satellite detects reflected solar radiation or radiation emitted by the earth/atmosphere) techniques are used, most provide a measure of the total abundance of the constituent of interest (e.g., ozone or particulates) through a path between the earth’s surface and the top of the atmosphere. For some applications, such a columnar abundance measurement is directly usable. But that’s not the case for understanding air quality down at the surface where we breathe. Despite numerous efforts to link what a satellite can observe with surface concentrations, there is (and always will be) considerable uncertainty. Even so, satellites offer the only source of information for most of the world, where dense monitoring networks like we have in Southern California don’t exist. Technological advances are also leading to increasingly powerful and accurate satellites and data products. An example is the recently launched TEMPO satellite, which provides spatially and temporally resolved concentrations of NO2 and other pollutants.

For this lab you will use handheld sensors to measure the particulate matter concentration (what we need for understanding air quality and health impacts) and the columnar loading of particulate matter between the ground and top of the atmosphere (similar to what a satellite could provide). Though it may not be necessary to make measurements at various locations as with Laboratory A, you should make measurements throughout much or all of your two lab periods to capture (and later explain) variations in each measurement individually and in the relationship between the two. 

The device used to measure concentration is the same AirBeam sensor used for Laboratory C. If you do this lab before that one, at least one group member will need to install the AirBeam app on their phone(s) to record and transmit the data. Though these sensors are nice because they are cheap and small, they are not as accurate as regulatory monitors such as those maintained by SCAQMD/CARB. 

The sensor used to remotely measure columnar “abundance” of particulate matter is called a sunphotometer. It is manually pointed at the sun and measures solar intensity at a set of discrete wavelength bands. The measurements are used to calculate what is referred to as the aerosol optical depth, or AOD, which describes the fractional attenuation of solar radiation as it travels through the atmosphere. For an overhead sun (so no slant), the fraction transmitted = exp(- AOD). The measurement is only possible when you (and the sunphotometer) can see the sun. So it is OK if there are clouds, but not OK if they are blocking the sun. Make sure to align the times of the two measurements. When analyzing the data, you may want to connect your data with those from a network of automated sunphotometers (Aeronet) and/or satellite data. Your instructor/TA can help you find and use those or other datasets.
