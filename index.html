<p><strong>Laboratory Reports</strong> Each group will turn in a report for each of the five labs that summarizes the experimental design and results. The grade assigned to each student will be based on a rubric that includes quality of the data and report and will be weighted based on individual contribution to the lab and report. </p>
<p><strong>Presentations</strong> Each student will be required to contribute to group presentations on results from two of the five labs. Present any two labs of your choice. One objective is to help students place their results into context by comparing and contrasting with those from other groups.</p>
<p><strong>Participation</strong> Attendance in lab sessions and discussion is mandatory. Lab sessions marked as as make-up/group work are available for meetings of the groups with the instructor to discuss expectations and hypotheses for upcoming labs and findings and analysis for completed labs. Participation in the meetings and in other discussions in lab contributes  20&#37; of your course grade. The participation score will be computed based on recorded attendance, participation in discussion, and peer-evaluations of group work. </p>
<p><strong>Late Homework</strong> Late submissions will receive no credit. An extension with partial credit <em>may</em> be granted if the student can document extenuating circumstances related to an extensive period of excused absence between the date that the homework assigned and the due date. In addition, <em>religious observances</em> or other <em>unanticipated life events</em> may interfere with class attendance and homework submission. These <em>may</em> qualify for an extension, provided sufficient documentation is presented. </p>
<p><strong>Definition of Letter Grades</strong></p>
<p>This Course uses Letter Grading: A&#43;, A, A-, B&#43;, B, B-, C&#43;, C, C-, D&#43;, D, D-, F, I, W. Grading policies follow <a href="https://senate.ucr.edu/regulations/section/513/01">UCR Regulations</a>., Letter grades are defined as follows:</p>
<p><strong>A - Distinction, indicating exceptional achievement.</strong> Mastery of course content at the highest level of attainment that can reasonably be expected of students at a given stage of development.</p>
<p><strong>B - High pass, indicating more than minimal competence but less than exceptional achievement.</strong> Strong performance demonstrating a high level of attainment for a student at a given stage of development.</p>
<p><strong>C - Pass, indicating competence.</strong> Totally acceptable performance demonstrating an adequate level of attainment for a student at a given stage of development.</p>
<p><strong>D - Marginal pass.</strong> This grade is used to recognize that a student‚Äôs performance was marginal but clearly better than that of students who receive an F.</p>
<p><strong>F - Fail.</strong> This grade is used to indicate that the student has failed the course and will not receive any credit for the course. The F grade indicates that the student‚Äôs performance in the required exercises has revealed almost no understanding of the course content.</p>
<p><strong>I - Incomplete.</strong> This grade is used as a temporary grade. At the discretion of the instructor, students may be given an GD grade for work not completed because of a serious interruption in their work not caused by the student‚Äôs negligence.</p>
<p><strong>W - Withdrawal.</strong> Used on student‚Äôs grade reports and transcripts to indicate all courses for which they have received official approval to drop or from which they have received official approval to withdraw after the deadlines for dropping.</p>
<p><strong>Mastery Based Grading</strong></p>
<p>This course will use mastery-based grading. Mastery based grading assigns letter grades &quot;A&quot; to &quot;F&quot; based on a point cutoff evaluated from the assignment rubric. </p>
<div class="note"><div class="title"><strong>‚úé Note</strong></div>
<div class="content">Mastery based grading will never reduce your grade. If you earned an 95/100, you demonstrated mastery. The assignment difficulty is typically at a level that full credit can be achieved.</div></div>
<p>Under some circumstances I <em>may</em> allow resubmission of an assignment for you to demonstrate mastery. </p>
<p><strong>Absence Policy</strong></p>
<p>Consistent class attendance is the number one predictor of academic success. Therefore, class attendance is required. Excused absences include</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Medical Conditions</p>
</li>
<li><p>Death in the Immediate Family</p>
</li>

<p>Students are encouraged to take an active role as their own advocates. They are not required to identify themselves as having a disability; however, students are not eligible for accommodations unless they self-identify. Students are responsible for visiting the SDRC office &#40;Student Disability Resource Center, 125 Costo Hall &#40;951&#41; 827-4538, <a href="http://sdrc.ucr.edu/">http://sdrc.ucr.edu/</a>, and obtaining and delivering letters detailing appropriate accommodations to each of their instructors in a timely manner every quarter. </p>
<p>Instructors are responsible for assisting in providing accommodations; students are required to make requests in an appropriate and timely manner. Ordinarily, required accommodations are described in a letter, which is given to the instructor by the student. Classroom accommodations may involve providing space for a sign language interpreter or real-time captionist, asking students to clear a path for wheelchair users, announcing need for note takers, for example. Some accommodations, such as materials in Braille, large print, or electronic format, readers, and special equipment for testing or composing papers, are provided outside of the classroom by SDRC.
