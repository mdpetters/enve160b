#### Course Objectives

This course introduces students to concepts essential for making and analyzing measurements relevant to environmental engineering. It is intended to help train students to design and conduct reliable experimental measurements. The main objectives of the course are to apply the fundamental concepts developed in previous coursework, to set up and conduct complex experiments, and to support the theories formulated in lecture courses. The experiments give students an opportunity to think creatively, apply the skills developed in lecture courses, and communicate effectively through written and oral reports.

\outcomes{
1. Gain hands on experience with air quality measurement techniques
2. Engage in design and conduct of open-ended experiments 
3. Gain familiarity with reporting methods of environmental data
4. Be able to put measurements into perspective based on results available in the literature
5. Work in complex team environment to accomplish significant tasks
6. Employ statistical techniques in interpretation of collected data
7. Gain experience presenting results in group setting and in participating in an active discussion aimed at encouraging the different groups to integrate and interpret their results.

#### Assessment
Assessment of learning objectives will be through participation, presentations, and laboratory reports. 


#### Evaluation of Student Performance

The grade components in the class include:

| Activity      | Weight | Details                                                        |
| --------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Laboratory Reports     | 50%    | Five (5) laboratory reports.                          |
| Presentations          | 30%    | Two (2) group presentations.                          |
| Participation          | 20%    | Attendance and participation.                         |

**Laboratory Reports**
Each group will turn in a report for each of the five labs that summarizes the experimental design and results. The grade assigned to each student will be based on a rubric that includes quality of the data and report and will be weighted based on individual contribution to the lab and report. Spelling, grammar, and general writing style will be considered when grading the reports. Reports will be due on Fridays at 11:59 pm at the end of the weeks specified in the schedule below. You can choose which report to submit each week; you do not need to submit reports in the same order in which you did the labs. The electronic submissions must be formatted into single documents, preferably a google doc shared with write access. Reports must be submitted by each group member through Canvas. 

**Presentations**
Each student will be required to contribute to group presentations on results from two of the five labs. Present any two labs of your choice. One objective is to help students place their results into context by comparing and contrasting with those from other groups.


**Participation**
Attendance in lab sessions and discussion is mandatory. Lab sessions marked as as make-up/group work are available for meetings of the groups with the instructor to discuss expectations and hypotheses for upcoming labs and findings and analysis for completed labs. Participation in the meetings and in other discussions in lab contributes  20% of your course grade. The participation score will be computed based on recorded attendance, participation in discussion, and peer-evaluations of group work. 


**Late Homework**
Late submissions will receive no credit. An extension with partial credit *may* be granted if the student can document extenuating circumstances related to an extensive period of excused absence between the date that the homework assigned and the due date. In addition, *religious observances* or other *unanticipated life events* may interfere with class attendance and homework submission. These *may* qualify for an extension, provided sufficient documentation is presented. 

**Definition of Letter Grades**

This Course uses Letter Grading: A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F, I, W. Grading policies follow [UCR Regulations](https://senate.ucr.edu/regulations/section/513/01)., Letter grades are defined as follows:

**A - Distinction, indicating exceptional achievement.** Mastery of course content at the highest level of attainment that can reasonably be expected of students at a given stage of development.

**B - High pass, indicating more than minimal competence but less than exceptional achievement.** Strong performance demonstrating a high level of attainment for a student at a given stage of development.

**C - Pass, indicating competence.** Totally acceptable performance demonstrating an adequate level of attainment for a student at a given stage of development.

**D - Marginal pass.** This grade is used to recognize that a student’s performance was marginal but clearly better than that of students who receive an F.

**F - Fail.** This grade is used to indicate that the student has failed the course and will not receive any credit for the course. The F grade indicates that the student’s performance in the required exercises has revealed almost no understanding of the course content.

**I - Incomplete.** This grade is used as a temporary grade. At the discretion of the instructor, students may be given an GD grade for work not completed because of a serious interruption in their work not caused by the student’s negligence.

**W - Withdrawal.** Used on student’s grade reports and transcripts to indicate all courses for which they have received official approval to drop or from which they have received official approval to withdraw after the deadlines for dropping.

**Mastery Based Grading**

This course will use mastery-based grading. Mastery based grading assigns letter grades "A" to "F" based on a point cutoff evaluated from the assignment rubric. 

\note{
Mastery based grading will never reduce your grade. If you earned an 95/100, you demonstrated mastery. The assignment difficulty is typically at a level that full credit can be achieved.
}

Under some circumstances I *may* allow resubmission of an assignment for you to demonstrate mastery. 

**Absence Policy**

Consistent class attendance is the number one predictor of academic success. Therefore, class attendance is required. Excused absences include
1. Medical Conditions
2. Death in the Immediate Family
3. Military Orders
3. Legal Obligations

Written verification from a from physician, lawyer, judge, or commanding officer needs to be provided for any makeup exam.

#### Methods of Student Instruction
- Laboratory Session: Hands on work to collect measurements and interact with the instructors. Used for developing measurement plans and working out hypotheses. 
- Report Writing: Students submit reports and obtain timely feedback to help improve future reports.
- Discussion Sessions: Discussion sessions are used for group presentations.  

#### Readings and Recommended Texts
Reading material is linked to each lab session.

#### Academic Accommodations
Students are encouraged to take an active role as their own advocates. They are not required to identify themselves as having a disability; however, students are not eligible for accommodations unless they self-identify. Students are responsible for visiting the SDRC office (Student Disability Resource Center, 125 Costo Hall (951) 827-4538, [http://sdrc.ucr.edu/](http://sdrc.ucr.edu/), and obtaining and delivering letters detailing appropriate accommodations to each of their instructors in a timely manner every quarter. 

Instructors are responsible for assisting in providing accommodations; students are required to make requests in an appropriate and timely manner. Ordinarily, required accommodations are described in a letter, which is given to the instructor by the student. Classroom accommodations may involve providing space for a sign language interpreter or real-time captionist, asking students to clear a path for wheelchair users, announcing need for note takers, for example. Some accommodations, such as materials in Braille, large print, or electronic format, readers, and special equipment for testing or composing papers, are provided outside of the classroom by SDRC.
