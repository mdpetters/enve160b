\prompt{
The goal is to measure the reactions of alkenes with ozone inside an environmental chamber. The group will prepare a mix of $O_3$, $NO_x$, and reactive alkene inside an environmental chamber and monitor the decay of $O_3$ with time. You should first add $O_3$ and $NO_x$ and then add 100 ppb of alkene. For the report you should detail the origin of alkenes in the atmosphere, the alkene ozonolysis mechanism, estimate products, estimate the reaction rate of the alkene with ozone, and contrast the rate with values found in the peer-reviewed literature. Explain the principle of operation of the gas-phase monitors. Discuss the role of wall loss and other potential experimental artifacts that may bias your results. Also discuss the implication for secondary organic aerosol formation, including estimates of particulate matter mass that may have formed in the you reaction.
