\prompt{
The goal is to measure the reactions of alkenes with ozone inside an environmental chamber. The group will prepare a mix of $O_3$, $NO_x$, and reactive alkene inside an environmental chamber and monitor the decay of $O_3$ with time. You should first add $O_3$, $NO_x$, and turn on the light. Then add 100 ppb of alkene. For the report you should detail the origin of alkenes in the atmosphere, the alkene ozonolysis mechanism, estimate products, estimate the reaction rate of the alkene with ozone, and of the stable Crigee intermediate with NO and $NO_2$. Contrast the rate with values found in the peer-reviewed literature. Explain the principle of operation of the gas-phase monitors. Discuss the role of wall loss and other potential experimental artifacts that may bias your results. Also discuss the implication for secondary organic aerosol formation, including estimates of particulate matter mass that may have formed in the you reaction.

This lab uses an environmental chamber, a photometric UV absorption $O_3$ analyzer and a chemiluminescence $NO_x$ analyzer. To measure $O_3$, a 254 nm UV light signal is passed through the sample cell where it is absorbed in proportion to the amount of ozone present. Periodically, a switching valve alternates measurement between the sample stream and a sample that has been scrubbed of ozone. The $NO_x$ instrument determines the concentration of nitric oxide ($NO$), total nitrogen oxides ($NO_x$) , the sum of $NO$ and $NO_2$) and nitrogen dioxide ($NO_2$) in a sample stream. The principle of operation is [chemiluminescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemiluminescence). Chemiluminescence is the emission of light from a chemical reaction and is triggered by the reaction of $NO$ with ozone $O_3$. The amount of light produced is linear with $NO$ concentration. $NO_2$ is measured by converting $NO_2$ with to $NO$ using heated molybdenum converter chip. 

## Background/Motivation

Alkenes are ubiquitous atmospheric VOCs that originate from both biogenic and anthropogenic sources. The double bond reacts quickly with $O_3$ and is one of the major degradation pathways of alkenes. The ozone alkene reaction starts with the $O_3$ addition to the double bond resulting in a primary ozonide. The primary ozonide decomposes into an aldehyde and a stabilized Crigee intermediate (SCI) biradical. The SCI then reacts with either (a) an adehyde, (b) an alcohol, (d) carbon monoxide,  (e) sulfur dioxide, (f) water vapor, (g) $NO$ or $NO_2$, or (h) with itself. Some of these compounds will then go on and contribute to PM2.5. Furthermore hydroxyl radicals are formed from the reaction at high yield. The alkene + $O_3$ reaction is therefore important for understanding the degradation and fate of alkenes in the atmosphere, for understanding the OH budget in the atmosphere, and for understanding PM2.5 formation from VOCs in the atmosphere.

Before the experiment, you will receive reagents from your TA, including a glass bulb with $O_3$, a glass bulb with $NO$, an empty glass bulb, and a vial with an alkene, and a vial with butanol. The $O_3$ and $NO$ bulbs will be pre-measured for you to give a concentration of ~500 ppb of $O_3$ and ~200 ppb of $NO$. You need to calculate the liquid volume of alkene and butanol to add to the bulb and then chamber. The target amount is ~100 ppb of alkene and ~200 ppb of butanol. Butanol will not react with $O_3$, but will react with $OH$ radicals formed during ozonolysis. This will allow you to use the decay of $O_3$ to estimate the reaction kinetics. You should investigate the decay of $NO$ and $NO_2$, but realize that the rate will be not only determined by SCI + $NO$ and SCI + $NO_2$, but also by additional radical reactions occurring in the chamber.
