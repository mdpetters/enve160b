# Peer-Evaluation Form

For each assignment, you will submit an anonymous peer-evaluation form where you can provide feedback on the group dynamics. The peer-evaluation will be taken into account for assigning mastery-based grades for reports and presentations. The form consists of numerical evaluations and open-ended questions.

## Form

Write the name of each of your group members in a separate column. For each person, indicate the extent to which you agree with the statement on the left, using a scale of 1-4 (1=strongly disagree; 2=disagree; 3=agree; 4=strongly agree). Total the numbers in each column.
