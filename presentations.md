# Group Presentations

Students will be graded as a group, rather than individually to simulate team environments in real-world contexts. Google forms using the rubric below will be filled out by all instructors. I will assign a mastery-based grade at the end of the quarter, taking in to account all submitted scores, as well as the group peer-evaluation forms submitted with the presentation.
