# Group Presentations

Students will be graded as a group, rather than individually to simulate team environments in real-world contexts. Google forms using the rubric below will be filled out by all instructors. I will assign a mastery-based grade at the end of the quarter, taking in to account all scores, as well as the group evaluation form submitted with the presentation.



## Peer-Evaluation Form

Write the name of each of your group members in a separate column. For each person, indicate the extent to which you agree with the statement on the left, using a scale of 1-4 (1=strongly disagree; 2=disagree; 3=agree; 4=strongly agree). Total the numbers in each column.

| Evaluation Criteria | Name 1   |
|---------------------|          |


However, because not all students may contribute equally to a collaborative project, one of the criterion – “Contribution to Group” – has been included to acknowledge the efforts of those students who have done an outstanding job and have acted as a “leader” for the group (e.g., coordinating and communicating with the group, setting up a collaborative presentation tool such as Google-Presentation or Prezi to work collaboratively, uploading it to the Dropbox or posting to a Discussion Board, etc.). 

Note: To help you determine the individual efforts and contributions of each student, it is recommended to include a “Journal Reflection” or “Group Evaluation Form” (that is graded) at the end of the collaborative project where students will self-assess their contribution, as well as the contributions of their group members for your consideration.
