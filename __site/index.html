<h4 id="assessment"><a href="#assessment" class="header-anchor">Assessment</a></h4>
<p>Assessment of learning objectives will be through assignments and exams. </p>
<h4 id="evaluation_of_student_performance"><a href="#evaluation_of_student_performance" class="header-anchor">Evaluation of Student Performance</a></h4>
<p>The grade components in the class include:</p>
<table><tr><th align="right">Activity</th><th align="right">Weight</th><th align="right">Details</th></tr><tr><td align="right">Laboratory Reports</td><td align="right">50&#37;</td><td align="right">Five &#40;5&#41; laboratory reports.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">Presentations</td><td align="right">30&#37;</td><td align="right">Two group presentations.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">Participation</td><td align="right">20&#37;</td><td align="right">Attendance and participation.</td></tr></table>
<p><strong>Laboratory Reports</strong> Each group will turn in a report for each of the five labs that summarizes the experimental design and results. The grade assigned to each student will be based on a combination of an assessment of the overall report &#40;70&#37;&#41; and of the individual contribution to the lab and report &#40;30&#37;&#41;. Spelling, grammar, and general writing style will be considered when grading the reports. Reports will be due on Sundays at 11:59 pm at the end of the weeks specified in the schedule below. You can choose which report to submit each week; you do not need to submit reports in the same order in which you did the labs. The electronic submissions must be formatted into single documents and in a way that they could simply be printed out &#40;e.g., not a combination of a Word and an Excel file&#41;. Reports must be submitted through Canvas by 11:59 p.m. </p>
<p><strong>Presentations</strong> Each student will be required to contribute to group presentations on results from two of the five labs. Each group will get to decide which two labs to present. An objective of these is to help students place their results into context by comparing and contrasting with those from the other groups. I will consider responses to questions from me and other students in the class when grading. I will randomly call on three students not presenting to ask questions after each talk. Lack of preparation or absence will be considered when assigning grades. The presentations will be given both during the discussion classes and in class at the end of the quarter.</p>
<p><strong>Participation</strong> I will schedule meetings with each group during weeks for which you are not fully occupied with a lab. We will use this time to discuss your expectations and hypotheses for upcoming labs and your findings and analysis for completed labs. Your participation in the meetings and in other discussions in lab will be counted as 20&#37; of your course grade. Groups cannot start a lab until all members are either present or have sent me an email explaining that they will be unable to attend lab that day.</p>
<p><strong>Late Homework</strong> Late homework will receive no credit. An extension may be granted if the student can document extenuating circumstances related to an extensive period of excused absence between the date that the homework assigned and the homework due date. In addition, <em>religious observances</em> or other <em>unanticipated life events</em> may interfere with class attendance and homework submission. These <em>may</em> qualify for an extension, provided sufficient documentation is presented.</p>
<p><strong>Definition of Letter Grades</strong></p>
<p>This Course uses Letter Grading: A&#43;, A, A-, B&#43;, B, B-, C&#43;, C, C-, D&#43;, D, D-, F, I, W. Grading policies follow <a href="https://senate.ucr.edu/regulations/section/513/01">UCR Regulations</a>., Letter grades are defined as follows:</p>
<p><strong>A - Distinction, indicating exceptional achievement.</strong> Mastery of course content at the highest level of attainment that can reasonably be expected of students at a given stage of development.</p>
<p><strong>B - High pass, indicating more than minimal competence but less than exceptional achievement.</strong> Strong performance demonstrating a high level of attainment for a student at a given stage of development.</p>
<p><strong>C - Pass, indicating competence.</strong> Totally acceptable performance demonstrating an adequate level of attainment for a student at a given stage of development.</p>
<p><strong>D - Marginal pass.</strong> This grade is used to recognize that a student’s performance was marginal but clearly better than that of students who receive an F.</p>
<p><strong>F - Fail.</strong> This grade is used to indicate that the student has failed the course and will not receive any credit for the course. The F grade indicates that the student’s performance in the required exercises has revealed almost no understanding of the course content.</p>
<p><strong>I - Incomplete.</strong> This grade is used as a temporary grade. At the discretion of the instructor, students may be given an GD grade for work not completed because of a serious interruption in their work not caused by the student’s negligence.</p>
<p><strong>W - Withdrawal.</strong> Used on student’s grade reports and transcripts to indicate all courses for which they have received official approval to drop or from which they have received official approval to withdraw after the deadlines for dropping.</p>
<p><strong>Mastery Based Grading</strong></p>
<p>This course will use mastery-based grading. Mastery based grading assigns letter grades &quot;A&quot; to &quot;F&quot; based on a point cutoff evaluated from the assignment rubric. </p>
<div class="note"><div class="title"><strong>✎ Note</strong></div>
<div class="content">Mastery based grading will never reduce your grade. If you earned an 95/100, you demonstrated mastery. The assignment difficulty is typically at a level that full credit can be achieved.</div></div>
<p>Under some circumstances I <em>may</em> allow resubmission of an assignment for you to demonstrate mastery. </p>
<p><strong>Absence Policy</strong></p>
<p>Consistent class attendance is the number one predictor of academic success. Therefore, class attendance is required. Excused absences include</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Medical Conditions</p>
</li>
<li><p>Death in the Immediate Family</p>
</li>
<li><p>Military Orders</p>
</li>
<li><p>Legal Obligations</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Written verification from a from physician, lawyer, judge, or commanding officer needs to be provided for any makeup exam.</p>

<h4 id="term_project"><a href="#term_project" class="header-anchor">Term Project</a></h4>
<p>You are tasked to design a field campaign to validate aerosol emissions at urban scale. You can pick the location &#40;metropolitan area&#41;, emission type &#40;e.g. mobile vs. stationary&#41;, aerosol type &#40;black carbon vs. secondary organic aerosol vs. inorganic sources&#41;. The main objective is to design a measurement campaign that is &#40;1&#41; feasible, &#40;2&#41; affordable, and &#40;3&#41; compelling. Feasible means that it is logistically possible to conduct the measurements. Examples of feasibility include site access, instrument availability, and personnel availability. Affordable means that you are limited in the number of high quality instruments you can deploy. An example of &quot;non-affordable&quot; would be a campaign that requires a fleet of specialized aircraft. Compelling means that the data will provide meaningful constraints on the emissions given the limitations of your sensors and the geographical area. Examples of &quot;not compelling&quot; would be insufficient sensitivity of the selected sensor&#40;s&#41;, insufficient temporal or spatial coverage, or interference by factors outside of your control, including meteorological factors. </p>
<p>Evaluation will focus on the following aspects</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problem statement &#40;description of the emission problem&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feasibility analysis &#40;is the project feasible&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Budget analysis &#40;is the project affordable&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Engineering objectives analysis &#40;is the project compelling&#41;</p>
